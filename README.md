# Burgers-Equation-PINN
Have used Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the Burger's Equation. The Burger's Equation is a simplified version of the Navier Stokes Equation. Here, the velocity is in one spatial dimension and the external force is neglected and without any pressure gradient. 

We give the initial condition u(t=0,x)=-sin(x) and the boundary condition u(t, x=-1,+1)=0. 

The model predicts the value of u(t,x) for the input (t,x).
